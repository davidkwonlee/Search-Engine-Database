# Search-Engine-Database

A Web Application Search Engine project done as a project for my CS121 - Information Retrieval course at UC Irvine. It returns the top 10 webpages in which the given Search Term appear. 

-This project parsed data from ~37,000 static webpages to find the number of ocurrences of all distinct words that appear atleast once.  
-This was then stored into an Inverted Index (txt file) and then parsed to populate a MySQL database in SORTED manner.  
-The user then can type the search terms desired (Search Terms) and send database requests to retrieve the top 10 webpages in which the search terms appear.
